This tool is written in **R** and allows the reproducible and scalable data processing of peak information acquired trough **Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS)**. The tool bridges the gap between the output of pre-analysis software like [**Thermo Xcalibur-TraceFinder**](https://www.thermofisher.com/de/de/home/industrial/mass-spectrometry/liquid-chromatography-mass-spectrometry-lc-ms/lc-ms-software/lc-ms-data-acquisition-software/tracefinder-software.html) or [**Shimadzu GCMS solution**](https://www.ssi.shimadzu.com/products/gas-chromatography-mass-spectrometry/gcmssolution-software.html) and required input formats for downstream metabolite analysis using common tools such as [**MetaboAnalyst**](https://www.metaboanalyst.ca). 

The software is very easy to install, includes additional plotting and reporting functions and can be run on machines operating **Windows**, **Mac OS** or **Linux**. It reads in individual pre-processed GC/MS data files containing metabolite-peak data of single samples, collects additional sample information regarding dry weight and creates condensed and normalised **Compound-Concentration Matrix** outputs suitable for further downstream analysis. Up to 198 input files of the type .pdf, .tsv, .csv, .txt or .xlsx can be processed at the same time.

The tool can be operated using either a GUI interface, R markdown, or the command line (the latter which is still work in progress). The tool has been tested on both Mac and Windows operating systems, analysing GC/MS data obtained from different algae samples. 


### Key Features

- **Simplicity**: The tool provides reproducible and scalable data analysis which can be executed across operating systems.
- **Integrated data extraction from .pdf and .xlsx files of common peak quantification tools**: Starting from .pdf files the tool allows easy extraction of GC/MS summary data from common pre-processing tools such as Thermo Xcalibur-TraceFinder or Shimadzu GCMS solution.

A more detailed functionality documentation can be found as part of the MetaPLMA publication: doi... (coming soon)

### Installing

**Clone/Download the repository from Github**

Get the latest version/release of the tool using the Pull or Git clone command

```
 git clone https://github.com/AndreHolzer/MetaPLMA --recursive
```

or for Windows: got to the [GitHub page](https://github.com/AndreHolzer/MetaPLMA) and download the latest release as .zip file ([Quick download](https://github.com/AndreHolzer/MetaPLMA/archive/master.zip))



### Usage

#### **Input**

The tool takes two different inputs, the GC/MS peak data (metabolite vs. peak intensity), as well as additional sample information regarding dry weights.

> **IMPORTANT**: FILE NAMES MUST NOT CONTAIN ANY SPACES

1. ##### GCMS data (required)

   GCMS data must contain information on Compounds, Response time (RT) and Peak Intensity (Response) and can be provided in several formats: 

   - `.pdf`: format from Thermo analysis output is supported and once loaded will be converted into .tsv format ([see example input](https://github.com/AndreHolzer/MetaPLMA/blob/master/example_data/input/Thermo-Xcaliber-Tracefinder/Thermo-example_output_1.pdf))
   - `.tsv`: format containing three columns (Compound, Retention time, Response) ([see example input](https://github.com/AndreHolzer/MetaPLMA/blob/master/example_data/input/Sample1.tsv))
   - `.csv`: format containing three columns (Compound, Retention time, Response) ([see example input](https://github.com/AndreHolzer/MetaPLMA/blob/master/example_data/input/Sample1.tsv))
   - `.xlsx`: format with first sheet containing three columns (Compound, Retention time, Response) or in Shimadzu output format ([see example input](https://github.com/AndreHolzer/MetaPLMA/blob/master/example_data/input/Shimadzu_GCMSsolution/1_1_fame.xlsx))

   

2. ##### Dry weights (optional)

   Dry weight information about the individual samples must be provided in a tab separate file of the following format. 

   | Sample                            | DW          | Unit                 |
   | --------------------------------- | ----------- | -------------------- |
   | \<File name including extension\> | \<integer\> | \<character string\> |
   | \<File name including extension\> | \<integer\> | \<character string\> |
   | \<File name including extension\> | \<integer\> | \<character string\> |

   > **IMPORTANT**: DO NOT USE ANY OTHER COLUMN NAMES

   Edit the [Sample_info.tsv](example_data/Sample_info.tsv) file to add specific sample dry weight conditions.



#### **Modes of execution**

- ##### Fast track (GUI interface and progress log) (<u>*coming soon*</u>)

  > **IMPORTANT**: NOT CURRENTLY SUPPORTED (WORK IN PROGRESS)

  Execute the analysis by a simple double click onto the

  - run.bat (on Windows)
  - run.sh (on Linus & Mac OS)

  

- ##### Full interactive track (GUI + progress log + full error reporting + code interaction possible)

  - Start RStudio and load/open the main analysis script ([MetaPLMA_main-anaylsis-script.R](scripts/MetaPLMA_main-anaylsis-script.R)) from the scripts folder
  - Klick Source to run the analysis

  > **IMPORTANT**: Once the analysis has finished check progress log and console to see whether there were any errors.

  

#### **Data Output**

A main output folder `<date>_GCSM-analysis-results` will be created under the select output directory which will include up to three output subfolder: `pdf2tsv` stores information that was extracted from from .pdf files (if input files where of this type), `plots` stores all plots generated, and `peak_data` stores all matrixes containing retention time and response data for all sample.

A final summary of the RT and Response data is stored in `<date>_GCSM-analysis-results/peak_data/<date>_MetaPLMA_analysis-results_retention-times_all-files.xlsx.xlsx` and `<date>_GCSM-analysis-results/peak_data/<date>_MetaPLMA_analysis-results_response-data_all-files.xlsx.xlsx` .


## Example/Test analysis

The tool comes with a set of GC-MS and LC-MS example data which is deposited in the [example_data](https://github.com/AndreHolzer/MetaPLMA/tree/master/example_data) folder. We recommend using this data for testing and training purposes. For a detailed usage example and tool guide, please have a look into the [example_analysis](https://github.com/AndreHolzer/MetaPLMA/tree/master/example_analysis) folder.
