[**Metapolish**](https://github.com/AndreHolzer/Metapolish) is a **R** tool that allows easy data processing of common **Liquid- and Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (LC-/GCMS)** raw peak data. The tool bridges the gap between the individual sample  peak list outputs generated by MS-analysis software like [**Thermo Xcalibur-TraceFinder**](https://www.thermofisher.com/de/de/home/industrial/mass-spectrometry/liquid-chromatography-mass-spectrometry-lc-ms/lc-ms-software/lc-ms-data-acquisition-software/tracefinder-software.html) or [**Shimadzu GCMS solution**](https://www.ssi.shimadzu.com/products/gas-chromatography-mass-spectrometry/gcmssolution-software.html) and the standardised metabolite-concentration matrix input required by downstream metabolite analysis applications such as [**MetaboAnalyst**](https://www.metaboanalyst.ca). 

The software is very easy to install, includes additional plotting and reporting functions and can be run on machines operating **Windows**, **Mac OS** or **Linux** in a reproducible and scalable manner. It reads in individual pre-processed LC-/GCMS data files containing compound-peak data of single samples, collects additional sample information regarding dry weight and creates normalised and polished **Metabolite-Concentration Matrix** outputs at different levels of condensation optimised for subseqeunt downstream analysis by MetaboAnalyst. Up to 198 input files of the type .pdf, .tsv, .csv, .txt or .xlsx can be processed at the same time.

The tool can be operated following graphical user interphases (GUI) on top of R markdown scripts. The tool has been tested on both Mac and Windows operating systems, predominantly analysing GC/MS data obtained from different algae samples. 



### Key Features

- **Simplicity**: The tool provides reproducible and scalable data analysis which can be executed across operating systems.
- **Integrated data extraction from .pdf and .xlsx files of common peak quantification tools**: Starting from .pdf files the tool allows easy extraction of GC/MS summary data from common pre-processing tools such as Thermo Xcalibur-TraceFinder or Shimadzu GCMS solution.
